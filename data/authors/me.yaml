bio: "I am a doctoral researcher in Political Science at the 
      University of Cologne.\n\n
      My research lies at the intersection of European politics, comparative 
      politics, and political communication. One recurring focus of my research concerns how political 
      actors and citizens respond to crises and institutional constraints in 
      multilevel political systems, with a particular focus on Europe.\n\n
      Substantively, my work examines crisis governance, political communication, 
      and public attitudes toward democratic institutions. Methodologically, I 
      combine theory-driven research with survey experiments, large-scale text 
      data, and computational approaches to the study of political behavior and 
      political discourse.\n\n
      Please feel free to explore my work and get in touch.\n\n"
