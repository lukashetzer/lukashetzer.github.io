**M.Sc., Summer term 2025, University of Cologne** 

**Co-taught with Jasmin Rath**

**Course Description:** 

This MA seminar combines survey research methods with the study of current political phenomena and pressing issues of democracy. We will cover general aspects of survey research such as sampling, measurement, and questionnaire design, as well as the design and application of survey experiments. From a substantive perspective, the course addresses topics such as (affective) polarization, the rise of populism and mainstream parties' dilemmas with regard to the radical right.  Students will gain practical skills in designing and analyzing surveys and learn how these methods can be used to examine current challenges facing democratic systems. In addition, students will gain hands-on experience with preparing survey data collection, including pre-registration, considerations for ethics approval and questionnaire programming with the software *Qualtrics*. The goal of the course is for students to develop a pre-analysis plan for a research project and complete all steps except data collection.

By the end of the course, successful students will achieve the following learning goals: 
- **Designing survey research:** Students have in-depth knowledge of core survey methods, including sampling, measurement, questionnaire design, and advanced techniques like vignettes and conjoint analyses.
- **Practical implementation of survey research:** Students will be able to implement research projects using survey methods, including programming questionnaires in Qualtrics, while ensuring adherence to ethical standards.
- **Evaluating survey designs:** Students will develop the ability to critically evaluate existing survey-based research designs in the context of recent developments on challenges for democracy.
- **Communication skills:** Students will improve their oral presentation and written communication skills, enabling them to develop, present, and refine research proposals while providing constructive feedback to their peers.
