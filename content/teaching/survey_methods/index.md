**M.Sc., summer term 2025 (with Jasmin Rath) & summer term 2026, University of Cologne** 


**Course Description:** 

This MA seminar introduces advanced survey research methods through the lens of current political phenomena and pressing challenges to democracy. The course covers core elements of survey research, including sampling strategies, measurement, and questionnaire design, as well as the design and application of survey experiments. Particular emphasis is placed on advanced techniques such as vignette studies, conjoint analysis, and AI-supported conversational interviewing as an emerging approach to survey data collection.

From a substantive perspective, the seminar engages with topics such as affective polarization, the rise of populism, and the strategic dilemmas faced by mainstream parties in response to the radical right. Students acquire practical skills in designing, implementing, and analyzing surveys, and learn how survey methods can be applied to the empirical study of contemporary democratic challenges.

The course provides hands-on experience with preparing survey data collection, including pre-registration, ethical considerations, and questionnaire programming using Qualtrics. By the end of the seminar, students develop a complete pre-analysis plan for an original research project and carry out all stages of the research process except data collection.

**Learning Goals** 

By the end of the course, successful students will achieve the following learning goals: 
- **Designing survey research:** Students develop in-depth knowledge of core survey methods, including sampling, measurement, and questionnaire design, as well as advanced techniques such as vignettes, conjoint analysis, and AI-based conversational interviewing.
- **Practical implementation of survey research:** Students are able to implement survey-based research projects, including programming questionnaires in Qualtrics, while adhering to ethical and methodological standards.
- **Evaluating survey designs:** Students acquire the ability to critically assess existing survey research designs in light of recent political developments and challenges to democratic governance.
- **Communication skills:** Students strengthen their oral and written communication skills by developing, presenting, and refining research proposals and by providing constructive feedback to peers.
