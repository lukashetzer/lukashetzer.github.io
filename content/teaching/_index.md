      title: "Teaching"
      text: I greatly enjoy teaching and mentoring students and see the classroom as an important source of intellectual exchange and inspiration. In my teaching, I place particular emphasis on connecting theoretical debates with empirical analysis and on actively engaging students in the research process. \n\n My teaching spans substantive and methods-oriented courses in political science at the undergraduate and graduate levels. It covers European politics, political behavior, and political communication, as well as survey and experimental methods, and text-as-data and AI-assisted approaches. \n\n In recognition of my teaching, I was awarded the Faculty’s Junior Teaching Prize in 2026 for my course European Politics in Times of Crisis.
