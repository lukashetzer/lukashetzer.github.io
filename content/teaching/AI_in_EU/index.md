**B.A., Winter term 2025/26, University of Cologne** 

**Course Description:** 

How is artificial intelligence transforming European politics - and how can we study these changes critically and analytically? This seminar explores the role of digitalization and AI in shaping the European Union’s political landscape, regulatory frameworks, and governance structures. Students will examine key EU legislation such as the AI Act and the Digital Services Act, while engaging with broader debates on risks, opportunities, and the EU’s role as a global standard-setter in digital governance.

In addition to reading and discussing political science and interdisciplinary literature, students will participate in a group foresight scenario project, applying future-thinking methods to imagine the political challenges and opportunities that digital technologies may pose for European integration. The seminar also includes multiple practical “lab” sessions introducing AI-assisted research methods - such as conversational AI tools and text classification techniques - combined with guidance on how to apply these methods in empirical political research. 

The seminar has an empirical-analytical focus. Familiarity with basic quantitative research methods and statistics is required.
