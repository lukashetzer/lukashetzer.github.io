**B.A., Winter term 2025/26, University of Cologne** 

**Course Description:** 

How is artificial intelligence transforming European politics, and how can these changes be studied critically and analytically? This seminar examines the role of digitalization and AI in shaping the European Union’s political landscape, regulatory frameworks, and systems of governance. The course engages with key EU legislation, including the Artificial Intelligence Act and the Digital Services Act, and situates these instruments within broader debates on technological risks, societal opportunities, and the EU’s role as a global standard-setter in digital governance.

In addition to engaging with political science and interdisciplinary literature, students take part in a group-based foresight scenario project that applies future-oriented methods to explore how digital technologies may reshape European integration. The seminar further includes several practical “lab” sessions introducing AI-assisted research methods - such as conversational AI tools and automated text classification - along with guidance on how these approaches can be applied in empirical political research.
