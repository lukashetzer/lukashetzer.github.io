**Course Description:** 

For decades, Europe has been plagued by multiple crises. For example, the financial crisis of 2008, the so-called refugee crisis of 2015, the coronavirus pandemic since 2021, and now the war of aggression against Ukraine have all brought about far-reaching changes in European politics and society. However, different crises seem to have different effects on political events: for example, the EU responded to the coronavirus pandemic with an economic recovery program worth €750 billion. Such a sign of solidarity was sorely missed by countries such as Italy and Greece in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Clear differences were also evident in the EU's handling of refugees in 2015 and 2022. While the EU responded in an uncoordinated manner to the arrival of many refugees, primarily from the Middle East, in 2015, it showed a swift, unified, and proactive response in 2022 when accepting Ukrainian refugees. 

In this seminar, we will examine the connections between crises and political responses to them. We will not only focus on the behavior of political decision-makers, but also explore the role of political preferences and political behavior among the population, as well as the influence of the media. In addition, we will examine the impact of crises on the development and continued existence of the EU as a political institution. At the beginning of the seminar, we will use current strategic foresight methods to discuss potential future crisis scenarios that will accompany us throughout the rest of the seminar. 

We will primarily deal with texts from political science and, in some cases, from related disciplines such as political economy, communication, and psychology. In addition to examining theoretical foundations and empirical literature, this seminar also includes a brief introduction to the programming language R, in which we will jointly replicate analyses from empirical texts and answer further research questions based on them.
