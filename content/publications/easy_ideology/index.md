abstract: "The terms left and right are widely used to describe the political orientation of individuals or parties. They are also employed in social science surveys to determine where people place themselves and where they place political parties in the political spectrum. Based on data from the last twelve years of the Ger- man Longitudinal Election Study (GLES), we show how political parties in Germany are perceived in terms of their left-right positioning, how their ideo- logical positioning has changed over the years, where voters of these parties position themselves, and how this positioning is related to perceived issue-specific positioning."
