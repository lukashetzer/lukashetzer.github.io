Abstract: Globalization  and  technological  change  are  arguably  the  most  prominent  sources  of  structural  labour market changes  in advanced  industrialized economies.  Policy experts  and economists  frequently debate many  possibilities  for policy  responses  to  these structural  changes, discussing  a wide  array  of political initiatives that  vary in  terms of  generosity,  level of  governance, different  kinds of  income maintenance together  with  or  instead  of  different  types  of  more  activating  education,  and  with  or  without  extra protectionist interventions. Public opinions towards a given policy response have been widely researched, both regarding  technological  change and  globalization, to  disentangle this  wide  array of policy options. However, much less understood or researched is how public support compares across policy responses or mixes of policy responses. This is also  true of the respected realms of how people view the appropriate policy  alternatives or  combinations  regarding  technological  change  and  globalization.  Which sources  of economic risk inspire  the most or least support from  populations for policy interventions to address the risks? And what  policy  mixes are  seen  as most  or  least  attractive to  address  such  risks? More  income maintenance  or  educational  adjustment  assistance?  More  or  less  (progressive  or  flat)  taxation?  More protectionism or more social policy assistance? National, local or more global governance? The paper  summarized  the findings  of  a large-scale  survey  experiment that  provides  answers to  these questions. The  analysis are  based on two  randomised survey  experiments fielded  in the second half  of 2020  among  20,000  respondents  and carried  out  in  eight  industrialised  democracies  (Germany,  Italy, Japan,  the  Netherlands,  Poland,  Sweden,  the  United  Kingdom  and  the  United  States  of  America). Randomised survey  experiments  allow establishing  causal links  between certain policy  features and  the respondents' preferences.  In detail,  the two  ‘conjoint  experiments’  used in  this study,  one  framed  and focused on policies to address technological risks and another framed and focused on policies to address globalization risks,  allow to understand,  in the eight  economies analysed, the  level of public  support on specific  policies  aimed  at  mitigating  structural  changes  due  to  two  risks  considered.  Overall,  findings indicate that policies proposed are generally well-received by respondents. Contrary to our expectations, respondents  do  not  meaningfully  differ  in  assessing  the  policies  to  address  technology  instead  of globalization  risks.  This  result  suggests  that  respondents'  preferences  for  social  policy  remedies  are consistent no matter which particular threat they face. Furthermore, the analysis reveals that respondents express  a  consistent  preference  against  several  policy  options  transversal  to  the  policy  dimensions considered in the study.
