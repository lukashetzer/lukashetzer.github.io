abstract: "To what extent do issues such as climate change or place of residence influence voting decisions and attitudes? How do candidates present themselves on Twitter and to what extent do they represent the electorate both in terms of content and socio-demographics? The upcoming issue of easy is dedicated to the 2021 German federal election. Eight articles deal with research questions from the field of electoral research, with a particular focus on data from the German Longitudinal Election Study (GLES)."
